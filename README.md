## Architecture

BREACH::HARBOR is elegantly streamlined into three primary components:

<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><h3>üîç COLLECTOR</h3></td>
      <td align="center"><h3>üß† CORE API</h3></td>
      <td align="center"><h3>üõ°Ô∏è DEFENDER</h3></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>On the front lines, diligently gathering threat data from your environment</td>
      <td>Central hub where data is processed, analyzed, and visualized</td>
      <td>Enforces robust security policies based on intelligence from the Core API</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

**This repository contains the Core API**, including both the backend (Python/Django) and the frontend (ReactJS).
